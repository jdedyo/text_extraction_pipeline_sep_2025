Text extraction pipeline built by John M Dedyo in 2025, based heavily on work by Antoine Arnoud available at (https://github.com/antoinearnoud/pensions401k).

Progress is tracked by the "Tracker()" class, which keeps track of where the .txt files are corresponding to each ack_id to record their status at any point in the pipeline.
